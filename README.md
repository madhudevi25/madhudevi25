## Hi there 👋

<!--
**madhudevi25/madhudevi25** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

🔭 I’m currently working on AI and analytics product experiments—small, hands-on prototypes to validate feasibility, explore trade-offs, and de-risk product ideas before scale.

🌱 I’m currently learning how agentic AI, workflow automation, and data platforms change product discovery, delivery, and decision-making.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on early-stage AI, analytics, or data-driven product ideas where experimentation and learning matter more than polish.

🤔 I’m looking for help with stress-testing assumptions, edge cases, and real-world constraints in AI-enabled products.

💬 Ask me about AI product strategy and management, analytics platforms, feasibility prototyping, and translating ambiguous business problems into executable plans.

📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhudevi/

😄 Pronouns: she/her

⚡ Fun fact: I use GitHub as a product thinking lab—not a portfolio of finished systems.
